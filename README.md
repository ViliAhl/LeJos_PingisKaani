Robot project created on LeJOS LEGO Mindstorms EV3 platform.

Robot takes video with a webcam and tracks movement. 
It is able to track an orange pingpong ball and move accordingly in order to block it.
The computational capabilities of the EV3 Brick aren't great so the image processing and moving is not super fast but it works.
It can also go into remote control mode where it is controlled from a computer with arrow keys.

For motion tracking it uses OpenCV Open Source Computer Vision Java library.
